# Advent of Code

This is a personal repository of [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.

# About this Repository

I first discovered Advent of Code in 2022, and started solving it in 2024. Although I did not solve every puzzle that year, it has stayed on my radar ever since. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions for the puzzles.

> [!NOTE]
> My idea was to write the solutions in C as a refresher, since it has been a couple of years since I have used C extensively. As such, the solutions may not be the most optimal or fastest ones.

In each year's directory you will find:

* `README.md`: A file describing my thought processes behind each solution
* `solutions/`: A directory containing the solutions for each day in that year's AoC challenge

# How to Run

To run the solutions, you will need to download the inputs for the task from the AoC website. After saving those in a file, compile the `.c` source codes and run the solution, e.g.:

```bash
gcc day_1.c
./a.out path/to/your/input.txt
```
